# Varnish Inspector

A simple Google Chrome extension that shows if a page being served up via a Varnish web accelerator is fresh or not.

## Screenshots

Currently this addon consists of a single toolbar button that changes state based on detected HTTP headers.

### Default

The button icon appears gray/disabled when no special HTTP headers are detected.

### Varnish detected

The button icon becomes Varnish-blue when the HTTP header `Via` is detected containing the string "varnish" or if the `Age` HTTP header appears:

The label text is updated to reflect the number of cache hits if the HTTP header `X-Cache-Hits` is present.
